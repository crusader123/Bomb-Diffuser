** _Code Decomposition_
   I have just divided my code in 2 files.One is main file- 201101008\_robot.py which will
run my game.Another is a file named 'robocop' which I have used in my main file to
print the name of my game. 
** _Class Decomposition_
I have roughly made 5-6 classes in my code.I have made them since they are an efficient
way of distributing our work synchronously.For each different task I have made different
class.So this can help me even while debugging my code.
These are the following classes I used:

*introduction*-This class displays the name of my game:'ROBOCOP'.
It has a method
_an(self)_ which opens file named 'robocop' and read it line by line and add each line to the
screen.


*field*-This class just produces the blueprint of the  background field of my game.
Along with it,it is adding robot,codes and bomb in the field.

It has the following method
_add(self)_ - this method adds codes and bomb o the random position.
_addrob(self)_-this adds robot to my game field.


*hello*-This class contains methods which helps in building of my patterns sequentially
character by character.For example,I have print HELLO.... using this class and passing
appropriate parameters.
the methods included in this class:
_screenx(self,x1,x2,x3,y1,y2)_-this methods adds character 'X' to the screen horizontally.

_screeny(self,y1,y2,y3,x1,x2)_-this adds 'X' vertically.

_show(self)_-this is just for holding screen.


*name*-This class is displaying the window for entering he name.
_end(self)_-ends the screen

_show1(self)_-holds the screen.

   

*rob(field)*-This class inherits the class *field*.The basic purpose of this class 
is to move the robot.

the methods :
_move(self,tmout)_-This is the most inportant method.This moves the robot.


_barrier(self)_-this method adds barrier for level2.

*level2*-This displays the introduction window for level2.

** _Advantages_

I have tried to design my classes in such a way that all small operations are 
performed separately.This has increased modularity in my programming.Suppose 
there is a bug in certain part of the code or I want to change certain thing
in my operation,instead of exploring the whole code,I just need to go to that
class which is responsible for the operation and just make the necesary 
amendments. *for example*,if I want to change certain thing in movements 
of my robot , I will simply go to class 'rob' and then to its method 'move'.

Yeah,I have tried to keep my code as open as possile so that it can be 
used under different conditions also. *for example*, I have passed the size 
of field as an argument to function.Changing different argument will certainly
change the field size.

** _miscellaneous_

First of all,class introduction is instanted .Then name class is called on 
and then object of class hello is created and as a result hello window appears.
After that move method of rob class is called.the first level appears.
If u pass the first level then control transfers to class _level2_ and window
for level 2 apppears.then again the move method is called upon along with the
additional method _barrier_ which sets my level2.If u are able to collect all
the codes and then diffuse the bomb u appear to be winner.

** _Extra features_

--Well,my first page displays the name 'ROBOCOP',the name of my game.
--There is a page for entry of the Player Name.
--Then a greeting page come saying 'Hello'
--During the game,I display the message bomb active when all the codes
are not collected and when all the codes are collected the messages changes
'Gud all the codes are collected.Now rush to bomb.'
-- When 'p' is pressed in middle of game,the game stops and 'PAUS' is displayed.
--there is a level2.

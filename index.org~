** _Class Decomposition_
I have roughly made 5-6 classes in my code.I have made them since they are an efficient
way of distributing our work synchronouslly.For each different task I have made different
class.So this can help me even while debugging my code.
These are the following classes I used:

*introduction*-This class displays the name of my game:'ROBOCOP'.
It has a method
_an(self)_ which opens file named 'robocop' and read it line by line and add each line to the
screen.


*field*-This class just produces the blueprint of the  background field of my game.
Along with it,it is adding robot,codes and bomb in the field.

It has the following method
_add(self)_ - this method adds codes and bomb o the random position.
_addrob(self)_-this adds robot to my game field.


*hello*-This class contains methods which helps in building of my patterns sequentially
character by character.For example,I have print HELLO.... using this class and passing
appropriate parameters.
the methods included in this class:
_screenx(self,x1,x2,x3,y1,y2)_-this methods adds character 'X' to the screen horizontally.
_screeny(self,y1,y2,y3,x1,x2)_-this adds 'X' vertically.
_show(self)_-this is just for holding screen.


*name*-This class is displaying the window for entering he name.
_end(self)_-ends the screen
_show1(self)_-holds the screen.

   

*rob(field)*-This class inherits the class *field*.The basic purpose of this class 
is to move the robot.

the methods :
_move(self,tmout)_-This is the most inportant method.This moves the robot.
_barrier(self)_-this adds barrier for level2.

*level2*-This displays the introduction window for level2.
